  **Mark the points** : we have to find processes of malware activities like you can see here or catch any thing that looks like malware
 As we can see that Malware processes running `powershell``conhost``schtasks.exe` it means if malware starts processing a task scheduler which is schtasks.exe then it will download another malware at certain conditions were if we try to delete it then it will download again and hide itself this is called **PERSISTENCE**
